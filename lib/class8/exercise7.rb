# Write the following method:
#
#   Array#each_without_yolo(&block)
#
#     Iterates through an Array object, calling the `block` with each element.
#     However, of the element is some form of 'YOLO', it calls the block with
#     'Life is too short'.
#
#     %w(OMG YOLO ROTFL yolo FTW).each_without_yolo { |e| puts e }
#
#     Output:
#
#     OMG
#     Life is too short
#     ROTFL
#     Life is too short
#     FTW
