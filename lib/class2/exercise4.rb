# Write a program that asks for a person's first name, then middle name,
# then last name, and then greets the person using their full name.
#
# Here's how the program must work:
#
#   $ ruby exercise4.rb
#   What's your first name?
#   Samuel
#   What's your middle name?
#   Leroy
#   What's your last name?
#   Jackson
#   Nice to meet you, Samuel Leroy Jackson.
#
puts "What's your first name?"
first_name = gets.chomp

puts "What's your middle name?"
middle_name = gets.chomp

puts "What's your last name?"
last_name = gets.chomp

puts 'Nice to meet you, ' + first_name + ' ' + middle_name + ' ' + last_name + '!'
